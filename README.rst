.. Great experiments of the past - with added children!

====================
Experiments and kids
====================

We stand at the edges of an ever expanding bubble of human knowledge. 

I am a member of the UK Stem ambassadors program (I am not claiming
any endorsement there) and I think this is something worthwhile - a
list of instructions on conducting important experiments from
history - and what we can learn from them.

Obviously there are age related restrictions, some safety and some practicality restrictions - but I would hope that these experiments are not limited to Father and son in the garage - I would hope we will see some of these using school or public premises (with all suitable permissions) in time

Is it difficult?
----------------

To be fair most of we parents will get stuck once the experiments need calculus, but don't worry our kids can explain that to us !

Do I have to go back to school?  Well, not really - and that is I hope one of the benefits of a online community - we can sneakily ask for help without our kids listening in. 

So what is this?
----------------

This is just a listing of experiments - what to do, how to do it and what to learn.

It will grow in time.


Pre-history
-----------

* Fire
* Shelter
* Cutting Edges
* Food
* Clothing
* Travel
* Trade

Civilisation
------------

* Bronze
* Leather
* Trade and the Romans
* Infrastructure and Romans
* Iron and Song dynasty


There is a lot of intertwined sweeping history and technology above.  
And plenty of the "civlisation" era encompasses some of the great 
experiments - Erastothenes and the size of the Earth for example.

Science
-------

* Size of the Earth (Eratothenes, Ptolemy) - why it mattered to Columbus
  http://www.ciocookbook.com/philosophy/business_case.html

* Distance of the Moon

* Speed of Light (Jupiters moons or Michelson )

* Making a fire from wood (basic ember and notch, with bow.)

* Cannonballs and calculus

* microscope to view cells dividing

* Telescope to see a crater on the moon and work out distance to moon

* growing peas or fruti flies for genetics.

* Anything by Lavoisier, Boyle, Pascal, Davy, Faraday :-)

Maker-stuff
-----------

* the particle dectector - smoke filled container and radioactive material
  (Yes I think I am wondering off course here)

* Background microwave radiation

* Robots

* Satellite imagery

* launching balloon into space

Next steps
----------

I do want to make this happen - and am unsure if I can find the huge
well of energey to lift it to self-sustaining by myself.

So if you like the idea and want to get involved please submit 


The format of experiments
-------------------------

An experiment is best formatted as below::


  Name:: Calculating the size of the Earth

  History::
        <some notes on Erastothenes and why Columbus wanted to 
         sail round the world>

  Age group:: 
        7+ (Mathematics is fairly simple algebra and degrees)

  Requirements::

     XXX
        
  Options

      COntact with schools in equatorial climes may be useful for 
      encvouraging inter-community links and getting readings of 
      their sun declination and distance from "us"

  Method

      XXX
